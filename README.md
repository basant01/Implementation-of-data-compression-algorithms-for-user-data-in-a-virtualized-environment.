# Implementation-of-data-compression-algorithms-for-user-data-in-a-virtualized-environment.
Data compression using various algorithms on the host OS and getting the compressed data on guest OS running on a virtual machine using automation.The primary purpose of this project is to implement various data-compression techniques using the C programming language. Data compression seeks to reduce the number of bits used to store or transmit information, thus in project we are migrating the data between the host OS and the guest OS running on VM and automating the complete procedure of migration using the OS commands i.e. crontab is being used for this purpose. 
The Compression Algorithms implemented are LZSS ,LZW12 in this project.
